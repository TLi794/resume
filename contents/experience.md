### **Embodied AI-based Multi-terrain Service Robots with Dynamic SLAM and VLN Systems**  
**October 2024 – Present | RBM Group Project**  

We propose an embodied AI-based service robot in tegrating Dynamic SLAM and Vision-and-language Navigation (VLN) for autonomous operation in dynamic indoor environments. The system combines real-time mapping and positioning, object recognition, and language-guided task execution, achieving millimeter level accuracy in dynamic settings.

#### Key Contributions:  
- Built a hierarchical multi-layer map via integrating modern Semantic Mapping (Concept-Graphs, etc.) with conventional Multiple View Geometry (Back-projection reconstruction, etc.);
- Devised object-oriented/language-guided navigation on this map: search target (by LLM or VLM) via semantic layer while generating collision-free paths (by A-star, DWA, etc.) on geometric layer;
- Deployed this system on a wheeled robot, conducted testing and performance analysis via a web-based interface.

### **Vision-based Robotic Gesture Recognition and Control under Optical Camera Communication Interference**  
**October 2023 – June 2024 | Bachelor’s Dissertation**  

We built a robust touchless robotic control system for human-robot interacton via vision-based gesture recognition under the interference of optical camera communication. 

#### Key Contributions: 
- Designed a style-transfer-based denoising pipeline using CycleGAN to isolate gesture data from noisy image matrices;
- Integrated Swin-Transformer architecture to enhance spatial feature extraction and signal disentanglement;
- Deployed the model on ROS, with Qt-based visualization interface for real-time testing and control;
- Simulated camera and control nodes to evaluate system performance, improving gesture control accuracy from 58.3% to 89.1%.

### **A Privacy-preserving Biometric Identification Technology for Home Use based on WiFi Sensing**  
**October 2021 – October 2022 | CSIETPP**  

In smart-home environments, non-intrusive yet reliable identity recognition is essential for security. By replacing privacy-sensitive cameras with ambient WiFi signals, we can authenticate occupants without exposing their visual data. Furthermore, the ubiquity and plug-and-play nature of WiFi infrastructure make the solution exceptionally easy to deploy.

#### Key Contributions: 
- Leveraged fine-grained WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) to capture identity-related cues such as gait dynamics, instead of relying on the coarse-grained Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as in previous research.
- Designed a lightweight deep-learning classifier for CSI data, lifting identity-recognition accuracy to 94%.
