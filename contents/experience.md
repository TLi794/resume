### **Embodied AI-based Multi-terrain Service Robots with Dynamic SLAM and VLN Systems**  
**October 2024 – Present | RBM Group Project**  

We propose an embodied AI-based service robot in tegrating Dynamic SLAM and Vision-and-language Navigation (VLN) for autonomous operation in dynamic indoor environments. The system combines real-time mapping and positioning, object recognition, and language-guided task execution, achieving millimeter level accuracy in dynamic settings.

#### Key Contributions:  
- Built a hierarchical multi-layer map via integrating modern Semantic Mapping (Concept-Graphs, etc.) with conventional Multiple View Geometry (Back-projection reconstruction, etc.);
- Devised object-oriented/language-guided navigation on this map: search target (by LLM or VLM) via semantic layer while generating collision-free paths (by A-star, DWA, etc.) on geometric layer;
- Deployed this system on a wheeled robot, conducted testing and performance analysis via a web-based interface.
